Should foods and drinks be accepted on subways? Many students show different opinions. Some students think people should be allowed because it's people's right. Sometimes, passengers have to travel on subways for a long time, it's necessary for them to eat some snacks or drink some water, especially the old and children. Besides, many young people have to eat breakfast on subways in order to save time when they go to work. The new rule will affect their normal life and work.   However, other students disagree. They think that some passengers bring food and drinks to the subways, and throw rubbish everywhere. It smells terrible and make people uncomfortable.   In my opinion, I think it's not necessary to do this as long as passengers follow the rule, everyone should try their best to build a clean and healthy public environment."

True friends are the ones who can often sense and share your happiness and sorrow, like your brothers and sisters. They will help you when you have difficulties and feel happy when you succeed. True friends may also have different opinions, but they usually make a discussion instead of arguing or fighting.  When I make friends, the first thing I take into account is age because different ages mean different topics for discussion. In my opinion, most of us can hardly ignore generation gap during making friends with others. The second is sex. In China, boys don't usually make friends with girls because they always have different interests and hobbies. Meanwhile, girls always feel it inconvenient or difficult to talk freely to boys."

What's more, shared bikes are more environmentally friendly than cars, because shared bikes have become a new trend around the world, a good way of energy saving and low-carbon life. Last but not least, riding shared bikes is an excellent way to keep fit and live longer. By riding shared bikes, you can cut down on your risk of heart attacks, high blood pressure and other illnesses.  So I think, riding shared bikes actually has great effects on us.

Having read the news, I am filled with great joy. The measures to be taken will be the prevailing system, the most widely acknowledged system of choosing talents. Apart from the scores, other standards will be established so that colleges and universities will focus on students' individuality and overall qualities.  Among these proposals, I prefer the one that multiple exams each year should be carried out for some subjects. As we all know, once a student performs badly in the College Entrance Examination for some reasons, he may lose the chance to continue his study at college. Therefore, multiple tests makes up for this.  As far as I'm concerned, on the one hand, we can't deny the role the present system plays. For example, many people couldn't have changed their fate but for it. On the other hand, caring the score too much brings about many people with high scores and low abilities. So some proper reform is needed."

It is the teachers' guide online that has an advantage over the other columns. If necessary, the students can have a direct \"ask and answer\" with professional teachers. It is required that the composition should be related to the students' life. What's more, if it is organized well enough, the writer will be rewarded for it.  Hope to the students' participation."

His dream school is like this: the class begins at 8 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m.; we only have half an hour of homework every day and we have no homework at weekends; what's more, we can have a school trip once a month.  Tom wants to be a social worker in the future because he is always ready to help those who are in trouble."

As the teacher announced the plan to us, we were so excited as to let out cheers. On Sunday morning, we gathered at the school gate with good preparation. Then we set out for the mountain in high spirits. After two hours' bus ride, we arrived at our destination. With great excitement, we started our climbing. All the way, we chatted and laughed, breathing the fresh air. When someone was tired and fell behind, others would come and give a hand. Finally, everyone made it to the top of the mountain. Bathed in sunshine, we enjoyed the splendid view cheerfully.  The activity benefited us a lot. Not only did it free us from the heavy school work, it also promoted the friendship among us! What a wonderful day!"

Our teachers taught us how to make a fire. I forgot to take my lunchbox but my classmates were happy to share their food with me. We enjoyed lots of nice food and drinks together under the tree.   This camping really brought us a lot of fun and we learned to help each other when having problems.   I'm looking forward to another fun days now."

As for their parents, they are worried about their children's grades. All of them hope that their own kid can get high scores so they ask their children to attend extra classes at the weekend.  In my opinion, as students and children, we need to understand our parents and try to communicate with them as often as possible. In addition, we can try to do something meaningful together with our parents like reading or seeing a film. In this way, our parents and us can understand each other much more than before."

It was a clothes shop, but very different from the ones at the shopping centre. The clothes looked very old.   She saw a suit she liked, but as soon as she tried it on, she realised something magic had happened.  Suddenly lots of people were asking her questions. They wanted to know what they should do about certain students and classes. She had become the head teacher of her school!   She spent the day changing the school rules so they were fairer for students. At the end of the day, she found herself back in the shop. She decided to visit it again the next day."

They always spend too much time chatting or watching movies on their mobile phones. They have less time to communicate with their friends and family members. They often feel anxious without mobile phones.  Depending on mobile phones too much is a kind of illness. It's bad for health. Looking at the mobile phones too often is bad for our eyes. Playing with mobile phones is a waste of time and gets in the way of study.  Phones can help us communicate more easily and know more about what's happening around the world. If we can use them at proper time and proper situations, they can help us have a better, happier life."

Each of us has a mobile phone so that we can communicate with each other more conveniently. Housework is divided equally in our family, like washing dishes, and watering flowers. The rules of my family are pretty strict. For example, I was not allowed to watch TV during weekdays. I must get back home before 6 o'clock. Time for playing computers shouldn't be over thirty minutes.  Even though these rules are strict, I know they just want me to be better. We love each other and support each other. I enjoy my family life very much."

What's more, listening is a good means to gain information from the outside world. Most importantly, we have more and more frequent international cooperation nowadays.  But others are against it. They insist that not everyone has to communicate with foreigners in the future.

In my opinion, it should be kept. Listening test currently still remains an effective measure to evaluate students' English learning."

First of all, our government attaches great importance to body\u00adbuilding activties and encourages people to get involved. It has launched many campaigns, aimed at promoting body building all over the country. So more and more people are willingly participating in taking exercise. In addition, the value in it is more widely recognized.  This phenomenon sets me thinking deeply. At the social level, with more and more people doing exercise, public health can be greatly improved, which will surely benefit the whole country. On a personal level, a healthy body is a powerful guarantee to improve the quality of life. Exercise can surely help you look good, feel good and keep fit."

Traditional culture has been closely related to the development of our nation since ancient times. The revival of a nation can not be short of traditional culture. A friend of mine, Tom, learned martial arts from his childhood.   Now, he can not only protect himself, but also his health is very healthy.   Fortunately, as a martial arts prodigy, he was invited to do TV shows and earned a lot of money to supplement his family. So I think it's very useful to learn traditional skills."

As a result, we ignore the normal communication with our teachers and classmates.  There is no doubt that cell phones have a negative impact on our life. Playing with cell phones makes it hard for us to concentrate on our lessons. Sending text messages makes us lose the ability to communicate with others. Worse still, we don't have much time for physical exercise.  So we'd better limit the time we spend using the cell phones. Besides, we should learn to communicate with our family members face to face, which helps build a harmonious family atmosphere."

I am good to others. I am also kind to animals. I like playing the guitar. I also like singing for the people in the old folk's home. I have ever organized a charity show to raise money for Save China's Tigers. And I keep some homeless little animals. Animals are our friends. We should love each other. I am always thinking protecting animals is protecting ourselves. If I can be a volunteer, I will work harder and do more meaningful things to protect animals. I will call on more people to love animals like me. I will try my best to make the world more united. Thank you for listening!"

I have so many rules that I can't do anything I like. I hope sometimes I could be allowed to play computer games for a while, it will make me relaxed."

The result is that what the parents did was not an invasion of privacy.  Having read the news, I quite appreciate what the judge did. For one thing, he admitted the privacy of juveniles, and for another, he admitted parents' right to supervise their child. Meanwhile, I felt glad because nowadays, more and more teenagers have legal consciousness.  If I were the child in the news, I would be very angry at what my parents did. However, I wouldn't turn to the court, because they did it just out of concern about me. I could understand them, but I just didn't approve of their manner.  In order to improve the relationship between parents and their children, I reckon communication is the best way to solve problems among them. Through communication, we can understand what's in each other's mind. Moreover, as children, we should be more active in reporting what has happened to us and seek help from our parents if necessary."

Millions of people were killed and thousands of children lost their families and schools. On hearing the news,we all felt sorry for them. In order to show our pity, we held a class meeting last Monday to discuss how to help the people, especially the homeless children, in the disaster-stricken areas. At last, we came up with a great idea and a flea market was held in the school yard to appeal students to sell their old things and raise money. Many students took part in it and 1,500 Yuan was contributed. We did hope what we had done could express our great concerns, and it was also our wish that the victims could beat the storms earlier and the children could return to school soon."

On Friday our teacher told us that we were going to watch a crosstalk. On hearing the news, we were so excited that we jumped up and down.  Upon arrival, we got into the theatre, queuing quietly and orderly though we couldn't wait to hear it. As we got seated, the show soon started. Watching and hearing two comics' humorous dialogues on the stage, we couldn't help bursting out laughing and giving them several rounds of applause.  After the performance, we were lucky enough to discuss the crosstalk with the comics. After knowing how to reveal the jokes and the roles they had played, some of us even put on the long gowns and tried their dialogues vividly.  On the way home, every one of us was still immersed in the atmosphere we had experienced that day because not only did we have a wonderful day, but also got a chance to experience such a fantastic Chinese traditional art form in person."

Is it okay for parents to punish their children?   It's quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have different attitudes towards it, just as the old saying goes \"Every advantage has its disadvantage. \" Those who support it think that punishing children is a common education method used by parents and they can stop their children's misconduct immediately. And they also argue that moderate punishment can let children learn from it.  However, many others are against it. They argue that punishment can make a child feel disrespected and lose confidence, which does no good to children's growth. Besides, one possible consequence is that children may learn to lie in order to avoid punishment.  In my opinion, parents should focus on cultivating children's consciousness instead of punishment. What's more, parents should guide their children with correct words and deeds in their daily life. After all, parents are their children's first teachers."

I often discuss with my classmates how to classify waste better.   We often go to the park to collect waste on weekends.  I think waste sorting can reduce the amount of waste  What is more, it can recycle resources, and it is good for the environment.

In my opinion, it is wrong to cheat in examinations because it breaks the rules of schools. We students should be honest and try to get good results by studying hard instead of cheating in examinations. What's more, we should improve our study methods and get well prepared for examinations."

I often travel by train because it's safer and much cheaper than taking planes. I have been to many places in China, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong. In my opinion, travelling can be very helpful. You can learn more about different cultures in different places, and you can also make many friends during travelling.

First of all, compared to cars, shared bikes are much cheaper to use and you don't have all the added costs of fuel, and parking. What's more, shared bikes are more environmentally friendly than cars, because shared bikes have become a new trend around the world, a good way of energy saving and low-carbon life. Last but not least, riding shared bikes is an excellent way to keep fit and live longer. By riding shared bikes, you can cut down on your risk of heart attacks, high blood pressure and other illnesses.  So I think, riding shared bikes actually has great effects on us.

There are some traditions in this holiday. For example, people would have a big dinner with their families. After dinner, they often enjoy the full moon which is round and bright. The other tradition of mid-autumn festival is eating moon cake. Moon cake is the essential of that day, which means reunion. As time goes by, there are various kinds of moon cakes, but they are much more expensive than before.

I think I will continue to play volleyball after school in the future. \uff08\uff09  All in all, after-school activities make my life more colorful and meaningful. \uff08\uff09"

Secondly, it also offers us more time to have breakfast. Breakfast provides energy for the whole morning. No breakfast will do harm to our health and our study.

Our team got a good start by beating two strong teams. However, our captain hurt his finger during the third game. He is the brain of our team. When thinking of losing of the center, we were all down and couldn't concentrate on the next match. Our captain found this and encouraged us to fight on and cheered us up. With the help of our captain, we played as well as the first two games. Seeing our captains waving his injured finger, we made our biggest efforts in the following games. With the cheers of our students, we won the champion. During the celebrations, we threw our captain into the air. I would never forget it because I understood the importance of teamwork for the first time."

In our daily life, we often meet some people who pretend to be expert in a certain field, but in fact, they know nothing, just like the pig in the picture. When these so-called experts give guidance to us, it is wise to question them first and not to accept their advice blindly. Otherwise,we may be misled.

The teachers give us live lectures on the app. And we need to send the homework to the teacher through the Internet after class. I believe I can learn online lessons well. Through online learning, students can learn anytime and anywhere. But looking at the computer screen for a long time will affect our eyesight. In order to enrich my life, I spare time after supper to do some favorite things, such as doing sports and listening to music. I also help my parents do some housework when I am free.

We can devote most of our time to helping others. Moreover, we can learn a let from doing voluntary work.

Last summer holiday, I wanted to learn how to swim. I asked my father to teach me.   I went to the swimming pool with my father. He taught me how to swim. At first, I was afraid of diving in the water. And I felt uncomfortable in the water. But my father always encouraged me. He said he would protect me. Then I began to swim, but I couldn't swim forward at all. It made me upset. Then my father told me how to move, how to stretch out my hands and legs.   Slowly, I could move a little. It took me about four hours to learn to swim.  I felt quite happy.  What an unforgettable thing it was!"

First, there will be less homework and more free time when studying abroad than in China. Second, there are fewer people in foreign countries, especially in the western countries, than in China. Third, better environment can be experienced due to less pollution. However, other students would rather study in China. The first reason is that studying in China is much less expensive than studying abroad. Second, students must do part-time jobs when study in western countries. Third, studying abroad means leaving family and being far away from friends.  As far as I am concerned, I will choose to study abroad when I am eighteen. At the age of 18, I have finished high school. And I will have been an adult. I think it's time for me to learn to look after myself instead of depending on my parents. They have the same thought.  This is my choice. Will you agree with me?"

Above all, as a native of the city, I know a lot about its history and culture. So I'm sure that the foreigners will appreciate my work and enjoy their stay in our city.

At the book fair, students can sell their unwanted books or buy books they need.  As a regular visitor, I have found myself increasingly attracted by trading books with my schoolmates. You know, prices of books at the book fair are typically very low. More importantly, a wide variety of books can help broaden my horizons.  Would you like to come? You will have a lot of fun there. Please let me know if you have made up your mind. Looking forward to your early reply!"

Your parents won't take your phone away if you only use it to make phone calls when necessary.   But if you use it to play games or chat with your friends, it will be a waste of time and do harm to your health and your study. For the problem communicating with your parents, I suggest you should talk to them more often and try to understand their minds.   The biggest reason for this problem is that your ways of looking at things are very different.   So, you should be patient with your parents and never argue with them, or the things will get even worse. With a little hard work, you can learn to communicate better with your parents. I hope my advice can be helpful to you."

They will talk about their studies and wonderful life experiences at Woodpark School in London.   If you are interested in the educational exchange, please join us at 3 p.m. this Friday afternoon in our school library.   You will have chances to ask their questions about the visit, so you'd better bring a notebook to copy down useful information and come on time. We look forward to your attendance. Thank you!
