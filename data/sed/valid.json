Likewise, nuclear also declined, becoming the third primary source of energy. The percentage of natural gas, on the other hand, witnessed the most noticeable increase during the period, rising from 13% to 23%.  Coal and other renewable resources saw the rise of 5% and 3% respectively. Interestingly, the proportion of the energy produced from the hydrogen, though not widely used, remained stable. Overall, this trend helps guarantee sustainable economic growth improve the environment and reduce the cost of living.   To my mind, we should enforce the use of other renewable resources such as solar energy, wind energy and water energy to protect our limited resources."

I have so many rules that I can't do anything I like. I hope sometimes I could be allowed to play computer games for a while, it will make me relaxed."

Those who choose to read cartoons account for 30% and only 10% enjoy reading literary works.  The reasons behind this may be as follows. First, many students are not interested in books that may have nothing to do with their grades. Additionally, many students complain that some literary works are difficult to understand. What's more, various forms of entertainment distract students' attention away from classics.  In my opinion, reading literary works is very important. It helps students learn about customs and cultures of both the past and the present, at home and abroad. Therefore, if keeping reading classics, we'll benefit a lot from them."

She gets up at seven in the morning, and goes to sleep at nine in the evening. She eats more fruit and vegetables and does more exercise to keep fit. It's important for her to wear clothes made of cotton and trainers because they are comfortable. Sometimes she helps her parents with the housework.  At the same time, she spends two hours doing her homework. She likes reading, so she also reads some books and newspapers in her free time every day. She holds a party, has a big dinner and likes to let off fireworks with her parents to celebrate the Spring Festival. She also likes to visit her grandparents. She thinks it's a very meaningful holiday."

She was visiting her aunt and uncle, who had bought a boat and were taking her out for the day on it.   Soon after her train arrived, they were leaving the harbour and sailing out into the sea.   However, an hour later, the engine suddenly stopped!   They could only just see the land, so Casey's aunt used the radio to call for help.  The helicopter took twenty minutes to arrive. A man came down on a rope and lifted Casey out of the boat, then went back for her aunt and uncle. She never thought she'd have a helicopter and a boat ride on the same day!"

Chengdu is famous for pandas, so we went to the zoo to see the lovely animals. They were so funny and we took lots of photos of them. I was also very glad to know that people were trying their best to protect the animals like pandas. After that, we went to taste a lot of local snacks. Most of them are so hot but delicious.  I think my trip to Chengdu was very exciting and meaningful because I not only enjoyed the beautiful scenery but also learned a lot about different culture."

When the big day came, we were full of confidence and did an excellent job. After several rounds of fierce competition, we beat the other competitors and won the first prize. Standing on the stage with our certificate, we felt really proud of ourselves.  From this event, not only did we experience the great charm of Chinese idioms but also we learned to be confident and calm while facing challenges."

Most of the students think that music should be played. As we know, music can produce a lively and happy atmosphere. Besides, after hard study, music can bring us relaxation, which reduces the tiredness. This can help us make full preparations for the next class. Listening to music also makes us feel happy.  On the other hand, some students don't think so. In their opinion, they can't get the expected effect from playing music, for the class break time is too short. What is needed most during the class break is peace instead of noise produced by music.  In my opinion, it is good to play some soft and peaceful music instead of loud music during the class break. In this way students can enjoy music as well as have a good rest. Besides, I suggest choosing some music that is suitable for middle school students."
